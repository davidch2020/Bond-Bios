    "The increase at the beginning can be attributed to many liberty bonds being sold at that time to finance WWI. As this resulted in more citizens and households deciding to own financial assets, the decrease soon after this in late 1919 can be attributed to the increase in discount rates used to curb the increase of bond prices, resulting in depreciation of bond prices.

    "As seen with the Secondary Market Price graphs of the Liberty and Victory Loans, there was a big drop in bond prices from 1920-1921 for all of these loans. This can be attributed to the Depression of 1920-1921. During this period, unemployment rates rose to 12%, and prices saw a 15% rise (\"In,\" 2021). Overall, the economy suffered a large recession. Consequently, the US government lost a significant amount of credibility, meaning higher yields and lower prices for the bonds were demanded. However, the US quickly recovered from this in 1922, meaning the government was able to gain credit back. Thus, yield demand wasn't as high, and prices as a result rose back up again. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Events potentially leading to price drop:\n",
    "Initially, when the US came out of WWI, the economy was expanding largely: unemployment decreased to 1.4% while productivity & inflation both increased (\"In,\" 2021). However, the Federal Reserve, in order to finance military operations, was trying to keep interest rates low (as this would decrease coupon rates), thus \"inflation increased unchecked, to the growing consternation of policy advisors\" (\"In,\" 2021). Due to reforms initiated to decrease inflation, which included a government spending cut by 75% and an increase of the discount rate, a recession ensued (\"In,\" 2021). "
