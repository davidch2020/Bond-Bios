        "The increase at the beginning can be attributed to many liberty bonds being sold at that time to finance WWI. As this resulted in more citizens and households deciding to own financial assets, the decrease soon after this in late 1919 can be attributed to the increase in discount rates used to curb the increase of bond prices, resulting in depreciation of bond prices. By 1935, most of the debt had already been paid back. \n"
