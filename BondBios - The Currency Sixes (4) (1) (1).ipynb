    "## Notable Events Impact:\n",
    "After the Pacific Railway Act, the Transcontinental Railroad average bond prices increased due to the increased governmental aid that was provided. Because investing in a seemingly \"risky\" project was not appealing, by providing government backing, there was more credibility and reduced risk for investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the 1864 Amendment which provided more government support for the building and ultimate completion of the railroad, the average bond prices peaked and fell. Because there were more opportunities for railroad companies to issue more bonds and begin selling land associated with the tracks, there was increased speculation. Further, many railroad companies were tied up in the Credit Mobilier Scandal of 1864-1867 where executives at Union Pacific overcharged railroad construction fees and manipulated contracts *(History.com Editors, 2022)*. Concerned with the financial stability of these companies, this could be an explanation to the decline in average prices. "

    "### Financial Institutions\n",
    "- **Banks and Investment Firms**: Financial institutions were key purchasers of Currency Sixes.

The first-mortgage status of these bonds provided a reliable return on investment, making them a preferred choice for institutions looking for stability.\n",
    "- **Risk Management**: For financial institutions, managing risk is crucial. Currency Sixes offered a low-risk investment with a guaranteed priority in repayment, which helped these institutions maintain a stable financial base.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Currency Sixes were set at a first-mortgage status over government-issued bonds after 1864 amendment legislation. First-mortgage status, or first lien, meant that in the event of a default, these bonds would be paid back before government-issued bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here was to create a more secure bond that appealed to a wider range of investors with lower risk tolerance, which increased the pool of potential buyers. By balancing the financial burden between the government and the private sector, the government could indirectly support private enterprises for the war without direct expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise the appeal towards investors, the federal government granted land to the railroads along the rights of way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 200 feet on each side of the track\n",
    "- Sections 10 miles square alternating on each side\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Union Pacific had a difficult time gathering investments to repay. Ten thousand shares of $1,000 each were needed to be issued (only 10% had to be paid at the time of subscription). However, only 31 shares were established despite marketing in 24 cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Railway executive Thomas C. Durant stepped in to promote shares of the Union Pacific. He put up the first installment of 10% himself and guaranteed investors against their loss on investment, eventually selling 2,177 shares by October 29, 1863.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large private investors, usually the executive leaders of the railroads, were tasked with promoting shares of their own projects. In this way, they were able to convince their acquaintances and others potentially interested to invest.\n",
    "*(Crocker, 2014), (DeMatos, 2023)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pricing: \n",
    "- Various amounts of the loan were based on the geographical difficulty of building the railroads.\n",
    "- Failure to complete the tracks by January 1, 1874, resulted in forfeiture of rights.\n",
    "- 'Easy Grade' was 16,000 dollars per mile [gentle slopes].\n",
    "- 'Moderate' was 32,000 dollars per mile.\n",
    "- 'Mountainous' was 48,000 dollars per mile.\n",
    "- The point of these prices could have been an incentive for the builders to finish the entire commissioned project instead of seeking small profits, thus creating a more sustainable source of funding for the investment.\n",
    "*(Crocker, 2014)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical Context: (Weidenmier), (Gallman, 1992)\n",
    "The issuance and performance of the Currency Sixes bonds were closely tied to the economic and political landscape of the time. Key events such as the Civil War, the Panic of 1873, and other economic crises affected the bond market and investor sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notable Events: (National Archives and Records Administration), (Crocker, 2014)\n",
    "- **Pacific Railway Act (1862):** This act facilitated the issuance of bonds to finance the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad.\n",
    "- **1864 Amendment to the Pacific Railway Act:** This amendment provided additional support and resources for the railroad construction, impacting the allocation and issuance of bonds.\n",
    "- **Panic of 1873:** This financial crisis led to significant fluctuations in bond prices as investors reacted to the economic downturn.\n",
    "- **Completion of the Transcontinental Railroad:** The successful completion of the railroad projects boosted investor confidence and supported the bond prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The Currency Sixes bonds were an important financial instrument in the history of the United States. Their role in funding the Transcontinental Railroads and their impact on the economic development of the country show the importance of these bonds in American history."
