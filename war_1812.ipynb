    "\n",
    "In the decade leading up to the War of 1812, “republican simplicity” dictated national economic and financial policy; President Thomas Jefferson advocated for a decentralized federal government and an agrarian society. However, in the final years before the outbreak of war, the nation’s finances and banking system were in a precarious position. Before the war, land sales and customs duties generated most of the government’s revenue and the government did not impose an income tax on its citizens. In 1811, one year before the war began, Congress refused to recharter the First Bank of the US despite Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin's best efforts to renew it. The lack of a national bank would prove to be consequential in the financing of the upcoming war. "

    "### Overview and Features\n",
    "<b>Six Percent Loan of 1812:</b> Congress allowed the President to borrow no more than **\\\\$ 11 million** through an act passed on March 14, 1812, three months before the war officially began. The interest rate was set at **6%, in quarterly payments** [1]. Bonds could be redeemed starting January 1, 1825. **Bonds could not be sold below par**. The treasury obtained <b>\\$ 8,134,700</b> through issuing these stock certificates [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Temporary Loan of 1812:</b> Authorized by the same act on March 14, 1812 that authorized the six percent loan of 1812. Bonds were redeemable based on contracts. Sold at par and at **6% interest in quarterly payments**. The final redemption occured on June 28, 1817. Around **\\$2,150,000** was obtained under special contracts with various banks according to Bayley [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Exchanged Six Percent Stock: </b>Congress authorized the exchanged six percent stock through an act on June 24, 1812. The act allowed individuals to trade in their old six percent stock in exchange for new six percent stock. These new stocks had the same features as the original stock. Gallatin had noted that by June, the \\\\$ 11 million loan only managed to bring in \\\\$ 6.46 million. Gallatin thought the new stock would increase the price of the bonds since according to Gallatin the old stock was selling 2-3% below par. The Treasury collected around **\\\\$ 2,984,746** worth of subscriptions of the exchanged six percent stock. The act did not have any new features compared to the old six percent stock. The act explicitly protected those who purchased the old six percent stock and did not wish to subcribe to the exchanged stock. The only individuals and banks who could purchase the new six percent stocks were those who already had the old six percent stock [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marketing and Buyers \n",
    "Not many banks and individuals were not interested in buying government debt and the modest interest rate (6%) did not excite many potential buyers. Another reason Potential buyers did not buy the six percent stock was because they were nervous that the United States could suffer defeat against Britain, who had the largest army and navy at the time. New Englanders remained unsympathetic to the war and Congress did not find a way to fulfill interest payments, which did not raise confidence. Meanwhile, securities markets were primarily regional, located in major cities such as New York. American firms lacked the ability to underwrite large securities issues, and American agents in Europe could not underwrite American securities issues. Due to the lack of capability, the Treasury announced the six percent bonds and simply waited for investors to come, but only \\\\$ 6.2 million was initially bought [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\\$4.2 million** bought by **banks** for their long-term portfolios.\n",
    "2. **\\$2.0 million** bought by **individuals** [2].  \n",

    "Prices dipped substantially during the latter half of 1814. From the end of June, 1814 to the end of January, 1815, prices decreased by 13.79%. The decrease in price coincides with the British Chesapeake campaign which saw the burning of Washington DC. The uptick in prices after January, 1815 can be explained by the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, ending the war. The market price reached a maximum of \\\\$ 109.50 by the end of June, 1822. The period from 1819 to the latter half of 1822 saw an increase in the price, coinciding with the Panic of 1819 and the ensuing financial crisis. The rise in prices during this time could be explained by the Second Bank's tighter monetary policy that reduced the money supply. This deflation would have in turn led to a rise in bond prices. "

    "The first issue of treasury notes were authorized by Congress on June 30, 1812. Congress decided to authorize the notes as a result of the Six Percent Loan in 1812 failing to attract enough buyers and an estimated \\\\$ 11 million deficit. Many Congressmen opposed the treasury notes and wanted to use other revenue sources such as taxation. They argued banks and people scared of paper money would not purchase treasury notes because they weren't worth as much in gold or silver and that they would appreciate like the Continental Currency during the American Revolution. Meanwhile, supporters argued silver was in short supply and gold was undervalued. Therefore, coins could not be made. Treasury notes were seen as a good replacement for the First Bank of the US's notes. Depreciation would be avoided because notes could be used to pay off taxes and banks would keep them in their reserves [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The act authorizing the notes states no more than **\\\\$ 5 million** could be issued. The interest rate was set at **5.4%** and the bond could be redeemed after 1 year. Notes were **sold at par**. The only two denomations for the first issue were: \\\\$ 100 and \\\\$ 1000 [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Marketing and Buyers\n",
    "Treasury notes could be be used to pay off taxes, duties, and debts [1]. These Treasury notes could also be exchanged for long-term bonds paying 7 percent interest [2]. <b>$3.5 million</b> ended up being sold to banks, mostly located in Mid-Atlantic states. By December 1, the remaining bills were sold off, many going to New England. According to Treasury Secretary Alexander Dallas, Treasury notes were bought primarily by \"necessitous creditors, or contractors in distress, or commissaries, quartermasters, and navy agents acting officially.\" Kagin cites the Niles Weekly Register, who observed how banks primarily used the notes as reserves, meaning they were not circulating. In his report to Congress, Secretary Dallas states most notes went towards paying taxes [3].\n",

    "The total outstanding follows a similar trend to the two previous long-term six percent bonds. There is a decrease in total oustanding from June to September, 1817. This aligns with Bayley's note that the comissioners of the sinking fund purchased \\\\$ 1,662,349.56 at par during the same time period. The commissioners of the sinking fund also purchased large amounts of the two previous long-term bonds during the same time. The decreases in total oustanding in 1824, 1825, and 1826 were due to acts of Congress that exchanged the amount redeemed for new 4.5% stock. Congress didn't want to pay the 6% stocks that were due in 1826 since the amount was too great. Therefore, they offered these new 4.5% stock payable in 1829 and 1830 to lessen the burden of themselves. However, these new stocks turned out to be a failure, with only one-tenth being sold of what was expected. \n",

    "### Overview and Features\n",
    "In 1814, the Treasury reported an estimated \\\\$ 29.4 million deficit. In addition, previous funds raised from bonds in 1813 had all been used up in fighting in Canada. Therefore, Congress authorized a long-term loan of \\$ 25 million on March 24, 1814. Different amounts of the loan would be raised at different times in the hopes of getting more subscribers [1].  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Ten Million Stock:</b>\n",
    "Redeemable after December 31, 1826. It sold at a discount of **80 percent face value**. Interest rate was set at **6 percent** in **quarterly** payments on January, April, July, and October. Agents received a commission of 1/4th of one cent sold. Congress appropriated \\$ 8 million to reimburse and pay interest on the loan. \n",
    "Amount of Stock Issued (Ten Million Loan): <b>\\$ 9,919,476.25</b> [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Six Million Stock:</b>\n",
    "Same features as the Ten Million Stock. \n",
    "Amount of Stock Issued (Six Million Loan): <b>\\$ 5,384,134.87</b> [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Undesignated Stock</b>\n",
    "For the most part, the same features as the Six Million and Ten Million Stock. However, stocks sold anywhere between **80-95% face value**. \n",
    "Amount of Stock Issued (Undesignated Loan): <b>\\$ 746,403.31</b>\n",
    "[1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Marketing and Buyers \n",
    "<b>Ten Million Loan:</b> Treasury Secretary George W. Campbell realized he would struggle to raise \\\\$ 25 million at once. He decided to raise \\\\$ 10 million first. He received offers totaling \\\\$ 11.9 million without relying on loan contractors. He sold \\\\$ 9.2 million at \\\\$ 88 per subscription. He ignored the remaining \\\\$ 2.7 million since they offered less per subscription [1][2]. Jacob Barker, a successful New York merchant, purchased \\\\$ 5 million worth of bonds (half of the total 10 million). Barker used a leveraged transaction to buy them; Barker sought loans from banks in the northeast to purchase the bonds and used the bonds as collateral [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Six Million Loan:</b> A new proposal of \\$ 6 million was offered beginning July 25, 1814. Bonds were sold at a discount of 20 percent. Due to the discount, the Treasury offered a rebate to the original buyers of the Ten Million Loan at a rate of \\\\$ 10 per hundred of stock held. Thus, the Treasury protected initial buyers from the price decrease. Agents earned commissions of 1/4th of one percent on any subscriptions over \\\\$ 25000 [1]. **Six Philadelphia banks** took \\\\$ 250,000 for Philadelphia's military defenses. **Seven Baltimore banks** took \\\\$ 675,000 for their city's defenses [1]. British forces would capture Washington DC that August and launch an assault on Baltimore in September [5]. The **corporation of New York City** subscribed to \\\\$ 1,100,000.87 worth of stocks for supplies and reinforcements of the city. Bayley also mentions the Baltimore committee of vigilance and safety and the Planters' Bank of Savannah as buyers [1]. Overall, the six million stock failed to sell due to the British invasion during the Chesapeake campaign. Therefore, \\\\$ 3 million were sent to Europe for sale, most likely to **David Parish** in Hamburg, Germany [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Undesignated Loan:</b> Subscriptions were obtained through contracts with corporations and banks. The contracts would have allowed specific terms to be negotiated, such as selling price. Several **corporations in Baltimore** subscribed to \\\\$ 150,000 of bonds to build a steam frigate to defend the city's port. The **Bank of Pennsylvania** subscribed to \\\\$ 43,222. The **Bank of Columbia** subscribed to \\\\$ 25000 and \\\\$ 100,000 from the Mechanics' Bank of Alexandria. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank of Columbia: located in the Washington DC (District of Columbia) \\\n",
    "Bank of Pennsylvania: established in 1793 and located in Philadelphia [4]. <br> \n",
    "Mechanics' Bank of Alexandria: chartered by Congress [2]; first incorporated in Alexandria, Virginia by an act of Congress in 1812 [3].  \n",

Therefore, by grouping them together, it becomes easier to compare the quantity of short-term bonds against long-term bonds at any given point. \n",

The primary purchasers were not many individuals, but a syndicate consisting of Astor, Parish, and Girard.\n",
